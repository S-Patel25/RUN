# RUN

RUN! is a simple endless runner game made in Unity where you play a cube dodging procedurally generated obstacles trying to survive for as long as possible!

# Instructions for playing

Clone the repo to your computer. Once that is done, click on the folder called RUN! After that, simply click on the RUN!.exe file and enjoy!

# Scripts written

Since this was a very small game, there weren't many scripts, however I added scripts for UI functionality, procedurally generating the obstacles, collision detection, tracking the score, scence management, and player movement. It was a very fun experience to play around with all of these scripts.
